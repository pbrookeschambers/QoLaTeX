#### Commands to add

- [ ] derivative, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\text{d} x}{\text{d} y}"> should have a single command taking two arguments
<!-- the img above is a hacky way to get latex rendered in markdown on github. some things would support mathjax, but it's a bit insecure so instead i'm sending the latex to a github api which returns the rendered equation as an svg image, which is then inserted  -->
